abstract: An increasing number of evaluations of social accountability (SA) interventions have been published
in the past decade, however, reporting gaps make it difficult to summarize findings. We developed the Social Account-
ability Reporting for Research (SAR4Research) checklist to support researchers to improve the documentation of SA pro-
cesses, context, study designs, and outcomes in the peer reviewed literature and to enhance application of findings.
